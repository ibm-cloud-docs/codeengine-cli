See [Limits and quotas for {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits) and [Supported memory and CPU combinations](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo).  \n - Fixed various bugs.  |
| 1.38.0 | 21 July 2022 | - Added support for the `--binding-resource-group-id` option on the **`project update`** command. Use this option to configure service binding access for all service instances in a resource group by specifying the ID of the resource group. \n - Fixed various bugs.  |
| 1.37.0 | 14 July 2022 | - Added support for running a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} job indefinitely so that the job does not time out by specifying `--mode daemon`. Support for `daemon` mode jobs applies for the following commands:  **`job create`**, **`job update`**, **`job get`**, **`job list`**, **`jobrun submit`**, **`jobrun resubmit`**, **`jobrun get`**, and **`jobrun list`**.   \n- When you specify the `--build-source` option with the **`app create`**, **`app update`**, **`job create`**, or **`job update`** commands, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} now runs a build run without first creating a build. For the apps or jobs that are created with this change, the associated `get` command output is updated accordingly. \n - Added the `--git-repo-secret-clear` option to the  **`build update`** command. Similarly, added the  `--build-git-repo-secret-clear` option to the  **`app update`** and **`job update`** commands. \n - Added the `--commit-clear` option to the  **`build update`** command.

You can now use the **`buildrun submit`** command to run one build run without the need to reference a build configuration. \n - The `--build` option to reference a build configuration is no longer required on the **`buildrun submit`** command. You can specify the `--name` option with other build options to run a single build with the **`buildrun submit`** command. The `--build` option is still available if you are referencing a build configuration.  \n - Added the following build options to the **`buildrun submit`** command:  `--commit`, `--context-dir`, `--dockerfile`, `--git-repo-secret`, `--registry-secret`, `--size`, and `--strategy`. \n - The **`subscription cron`**, and **`subscription cos`** commands are grouped into their subscription types (`cron` and `cos`) in the CLI Reference [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} CLI Reference](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-cli).
